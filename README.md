**News Classifier**
This project is a news classifier designed to determine whether an article is fake or real.

**Setup**
Before running the code, make the following adjustments:

**Colab Notebook**
Change CSV Directory: Update the directory path of the CSV files in the Colab notebook if running on your local machine.


**app.py**
Update Tokenizer and Model Paths: Modify the paths to the pickled tokenizer and model in the app.py file to match your local directory.


**Running the Streamlit App**
To run the Streamlit app:

Open the terminal in the location where the app.py file is stored.
Run the command: streamlit run app.py.
Once the app is running, enter the URL of the news article or add a document/paste text to classify its authenticity.
